# A production management and supervision system for the printing industry
The printing industry is being challenged by the increasing price of resources like paper, ink and energy meanwhile 
clients are asking for lower prices. A part of the solution to deal with this situation is to optimize 
the productivity. One leverage to to do so is to reduce as much as possible the resources consumed 
as input for a same amount of output.

I have implemtented a system to help this industry to deal with this situation. The SGR system provides the opportunity to improve
the productivity by facilitating the decision making. The SGR system :
- Provides real time production indicators to produce the required quantity and avoid wasting resources 
- Tracks the production incidents and identify the weaknesses helping the maintenance team to prioritize their actions 
- Allows all the teams to share the same information in order to communicate and organise more efficiently
- Helps the decision makers to refine their strategy and choice of investment by prodviding more than 50 different PKIs
